# ü™∏ Reef Architect ‚Äî v11.6 (October 19, 2025)

### **Overview**
Reef Architect v11.6 introduces complete integration of live Google Sheets data, refined page navigation, usability and styling consistency across all pages, and a new interactive **Feedback system** with PDF download and EmailJS support.  
This version builds on the v11.5 foundation by improving accessibility, navigation flow, and real-time data linkage between tanks, equipment, and species.
